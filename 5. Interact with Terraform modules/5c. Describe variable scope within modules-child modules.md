In Terraform, variable scope is an essential concept that dictates how values are passed and accessed between modules, child modules, and the root module. Here's how the variable scope works within modules and child modules:

### 1. **Root Module**

- The root module is the directory where Terraform is executed.
- Variables defined in the root module can be set in two ways:
    1. **From `terraform.tfvars` file** or using the `-var` flag in the CLI.
    2. **From environment variables** that follow the pattern `TF_VAR_variable_name`.
- These variables can be passed down to child modules via explicit input/output.

### 2. **Child Module**

- A **child module** is any module called from another module (typically from the root module).
- Each module (including child modules) has its **own isolated variable scope**. Variables declared in one module do not automatically become available in another module. Instead, values must be passed explicitly through inputs/outputs.

### 3. **Passing Variables to Child Modules**

To pass variables from the root module to a child module, you need to define inputs in the child module's `variables.tf` file and assign them in the root module's configuration.

Example:

- **Child Module (in `modules/network/variables.tf`):**
