## How I Study and What I Recommend

My study was entirely based on the [Hashicorp exam content list](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/certification-003/associate-review-003).

Strongly recommend doing practice exams. Personally, I recommend the [Bryan Krausen course](https://www.udemy.com/share/102Zak3@ZK_E48NmZ0a6jdTDvpQL8mD2ZcyODAfpJ7SB517d5y_WGXAMMR-RYsJtgTcrTYIyzA==/)!

Don't study only theory! Practice hands-on with Terraform. HashiCorp provides hands-on labs in the exam content list, there are some great exercises available.

This is a work in progress, and contributions or suggestions are welcome.
