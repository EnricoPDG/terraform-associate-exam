## Situations to use terraform import:
1. Existing resources managed outside of Terraform like VMs, networks, databases...
2. Migrating from other tools to Terraform.
3. Managing legacy infrastructure.
4. Bringing resources into state without changing infrastructure.
## Steps involved in importing:
1. The command `terraform import`, import existing infrastructure that was either created manually or by another tool, with the commando you can impo to Terraform state.
2. The command can only import one resource at a time.
3. To import a resource, first write a resource for it in your configuration, establishing the name by which it will be know to Terraform:
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
	# ...instance configuration...
}
```
4. Running `terraform import` can attach an existing instance to this resource configuration
```bash
$ terraform import aws_instance.example i-abcd1234
```
