The `terraform state` command is used for advanced state management. There are some cases where you may need to modify Terraform state.
Rather than modify the state directly, the `terraform state` commands can be used in many cases.

This command is a nested subcommand, meaning that it has further subcommands. These subcommands are listed to the left.
## Remote State
The terraform state subcommands all work with remote state just as if was local state. Reads and writes may take longer than normal.

## Backups
- All `terraform state` subcommands that modify the state write backup files. The path can be controlled with `-backup`.
- Subcommands that are read-only (such as list) do not write an y backup files.
- Backups for state modification **can not be disable**.

## State subcommands
1. View all resources in the state with `terraform state list`.
2. View specific resource information with `terraform state show <resource_address>`.
3. Pull the entire state as JSON with `terraform show -json`.
4. View detailed information about specific resource with `terrraform state show`.
