Enabling verbose logging in Terraform is helpful when you need more detailed information about what Terraform is doing during execution.

## When to use verbose logging:
1. Troubleshooting issues: experiencing error or unexpected behavior.
2. Debugging provider or API interactions.
3. Understanding terraform's interna processing.
4. Performance optimization.
5. Development and testing.

## How to enable verbose logging?
By setting the `TF_LOG` environment variable. The logging level can be set to various levels, such as `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, or `TRACE`.
```bash
$ export TF_LOG=DEBUG
```

Can also specify log file to write the logs:
```bash
export TF_LOG_PATH=./terraform.log
```

## Outcome/value of verbose logging:
- Detailed logs.
- Root cause analysis.
- Improved debugging.

Verbose logging can slow down execution and produce very large logs, so it's recommended to use it only when necessary for troubleshooting or debugging purposes.
