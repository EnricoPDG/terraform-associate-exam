## Command: login
The `terraform login` command can be used to automatically obtain and sabe an API token for HCP Terraform, Terraform Enterprise, or any other host that offers Terraform services.

### Usage
`terraform login [hostname]` 
if you don't provide an explicit hostname, Terraform will assume you want to log in to HCP terraform at `app.terraform.io`.

## Credentials Storage
By default, Terraform will obtain an API token and sabe it in plain text in a local CLI configuration file called `credentials.tfrc.json`. When you run `terraform login`, it will explain, specifically where it intends to sabe the API token and give you a chance to cancel if the current configuration is not desired.
If you don't wish to store your API token in the default location, you can optionally configure a [credentials helper program](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/config/config-file#credentials-helpers) which knows how to store and later retrieve credentials in some other system, such as your organization's existing secrets management system.

## Login Server Support
The `terraform login` command works with any server supporting the [login protocol](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/internals/login-protocol), including HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise.
