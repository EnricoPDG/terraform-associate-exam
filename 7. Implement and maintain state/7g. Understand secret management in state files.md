## Sensitive Data in State
Terraform state can contain sensitive data, depending on the resources in use and the definition of "sensitive"..

### Recommendation
If you manage any sensitive data with Terraform (like database passwords, user passwords, or private keys), treat the state itself as sensitive data.

Storing state remotely can provide better security. As of Terraform 0.9, Terraform does not persist state to the local disk when remote state is in use, and some backends can be configured to encrypt the state data at rest.
