If supported by your backend, Terraform will lock state for all operations that could write state. This prevents other from acquiring the lock and potentially corrupting your state.

State locking happens automatically on all operations that could write state. You won't see any message that it is happening. If locking fails, Terraform will not continue. You can disable state locking for most commands with `-lock` flag but it not recommended.

## Force Unlock
Terraform has a force-unlock command to manually unlock the state if unlocking failed.

**Be very careful with this command.** If you unlock the state when someone else is holding the lock it could cause multiple writers. Force unlock should only be used to unlock your own lock in the situation where automatic unlocking failed.

To protect you, the `force-unlock` command requires a unique lock ID. Terraform will output this lock ID if unlocking fails. This lock ID acts as a [nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce), ensuring that locks and unlocks target the correct lock.
