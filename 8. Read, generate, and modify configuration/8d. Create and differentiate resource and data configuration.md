## Resources
_Resources_ are the most important element in the Terraform language. Each resource block describes one or more infrastructure objects, such as virtual networks, compute instances, or higher-level components such as DNS records.
- [Resource Blocks](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.1.x/resources/syntax) documents the syntax for declaring resources.
- [Resource Behavior](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.1.x/resources/behavior) explains in more detail how Terraform handles resource declarations when applying a configuration.
- The Meta-Arguments section documents special arguments that can be used with every resource type, including [`depends_on`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.1.x/meta-arguments/depends_on), [`count`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.1.x/meta-arguments/count), [`for_each`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.1.x/meta-arguments/for_each), [`provider`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.1.x/meta-arguments/resource-provider), and [`lifecycle`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.1.x/meta-arguments/lifecycle).
- [Provisioners](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.1.x/resources/provisioners/syntax) documents configuring post-creation actions for a resource using the `provisioner` and `connection` blocks. Since provisioners are non-declarative and potentially unpredictable, we strongly recommend that you treat them as a last resort.
## Data Sources
Data sources allow Terraform to use information defined outside of Terraform, defined by another separate Terraform configuration, or modified by functions.

### Using Data Sources
A data source is accessed via a special kind of resource known as a _data resource_, declared using a `data` block:
```hcl
data "aws_ami" "example" {
  most_recent = true

  owners = ["self"]
  tags = {
    Name   = "app-server"
    Tested = "true"
  }
}
```
