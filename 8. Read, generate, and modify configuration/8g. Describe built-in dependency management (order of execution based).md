Terraform uses a declarative approach to manage dependencies between resources. Its built-in dependency management system ensures that resources are created, updated, and destroyed in the correct order based on their interdependencies. This document provides an overview of how Terraform handles dependencies and offers practical examples to illustrate its functionality.

### **Key Features:**

1. **Implicit Dependencies:**
    - Automatically inferred from references between resources.
    - Example: If `resource A` references an attribute of `resource B`, Terraform knows that `B` must be created before `A`.
2. **Explicit Dependencies:**
    - Declared using the `depends_on` argument.
    - Ensures that Terraform respects custom dependencies even if they are not explicitly referenced.
3. **Graph Theory:**
    - Terraform builds a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to represent resource dependencies.
    - This graph determines the execution order and ensures parallelization where possible.

## **Implicit Dependencies**
Implicit dependencies are created whenever a resource references another resource's attributes. Terraform identifies these relationships automatically.
### **Example:**
```
resource "aws_security_group" "example_sg" {
  name = "example-security-group"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.example_sg.id]
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The `aws_instance` resource depends on the `aws_security_group` because it references `aws_security_group.example_sg.id`.
- Terraform ensures the security group is created before the instance.

## **Explicit Dependencies**
Sometimes, resources have dependencies that are not evident from attribute references. In such cases, the `depends_on` argument is used.

### **Example:**
```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example_bucket" {
  bucket = "example-bucket"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket.example_bucket]
}
```

**Explanation:**
- Here, the `aws_instance` does not directly reference the `aws_s3_bucket`, but we use `depends_on` to enforce that the bucket is created before the instance.
