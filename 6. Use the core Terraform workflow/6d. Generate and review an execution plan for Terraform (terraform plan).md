The `terraform plan` command generates an execution plan to preview the changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure. It compares the current state with the desired configuration, proposing actions to align the two. The command does not apply changes but helps you review them before execution. You can also save plans for later execution or use alternative planning modes, such as destroy or refresh-only.
