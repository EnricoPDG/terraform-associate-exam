The `terraform destroy` command is used to remove all infrastructure resources managed by a specific Terraform configuration. It is commonly applied in development environments to clean up temporary resources. The command essentially works as a convenience alias for `terraform apply -destroy`, forcing Terraform to enter "destroy" mode. It can also generate a speculative plan using `terraform plan -destroy` to preview the destruction without executing it.
