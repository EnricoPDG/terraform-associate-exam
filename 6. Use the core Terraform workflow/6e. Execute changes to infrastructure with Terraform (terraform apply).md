The `terraform apply` command applies the actions proposed in a Terraform plan. It can either generate and execute a new plan or apply an existing saved plan. When running without arguments, Terraform generates a new plan and prompts for approval. If using a saved plan file, it applies the changes without prompting. Additional options like `-auto-approve`, `-json`, and `-lock=false` can modify its behavior for non-interactive and automated workflows.
