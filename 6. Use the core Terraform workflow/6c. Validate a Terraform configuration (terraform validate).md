The `terraform validate` command checks the syntax and consistency of Terraform configuration files. It ensures the configuration is valid **without** interacting with remote services like provider APIs. This command is useful for verifying reusable modules and checking attribute names and types. Validation requires an initialized directory, and it can be run with additional options like JSON output for automation purposes. For more context-specific validation (e.g., variable values), use `terraform plan`.
