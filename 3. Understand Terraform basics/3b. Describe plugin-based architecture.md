# How Terraform Works with Plugins
Terraform is logically split into two main parts **Terraform Core** and **Terraform Plugins**. Terraform core uses remote procedure calls (RPC) to communicate with Terraform plugins, and offers multiple ways to discover and load plugins to use.

## Terraform Core
Terraform Core is a statically-compiled binary written in Go.
The compiled binary is the command line tool `terraform`
### The primary responsibilities of Terraform Core are:
- Infrastructure as code: reading and interpolating configuration files and modules
- Resource state management
- Construction of the Resource Graph
- Plan execution 
- Communication with plugin over RPC

## Terraform Plugins
Terraform Plugins are written in Go and are executable binaries invoked by Terraform Core over RPC.
Each plugin exposes an implementation for a specific service, such as AWS or provisioner, such as bash.
All Providers and Provisioners used in Terraform configurations are plugins.
Terraform has several Provisioners built-in, while Providers are discovered dynamically as needed.

### The primary responsibilities of Provider Plugins are:
- Initialization of any included libraries used to make API calls
- Authentication with the infrastructure Provider
- Define managed resources and data sources that map to specific services
- Define functions that enable or simplify computational logic for practitioner configurations

### The primary responsibilities of Provisioner Plugins are:
- Executing commands or scripts on the designated Resource after creation, or on destruction
## Discovery
When `terraform init` is run, Terraform read configurations files to determine which plugins are necessary, search for it and decides with version to use it, and writes a lock file to ensure Terraform will use the same plugin versions in the directory until `terraform init` runs again.

## Plugins Locations
The [Terraform CLI docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/config/config-file#provider-installation) have up-to-date and detailed information about where Terraform looks for plugin binaries as part of `terraform init`. Consult that documentation for [information on where to place binaries during development](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/config/config-file#development-overrides-for-provider-developers).

## Selecting Plugins
After locating any installed plugins, `terraform init` compares them to the configurations's versions constraints and chooses a version for each plugin as follows:
- Uses the newest installed version that meets the constraint
- If no acceptable versions are installed and the plugin is one of the providers distributed by HashiCorp, Terraform downloads the newest acceptable version from the Terraform Registry and saves it in a subdirectory under `.terraform/providers`

## Upgrading Plugins
When `terraform init` is run with `-upgrade` options, it re-checks the Terraform Registry for newer acceptable provider versions and downloads them if available.
