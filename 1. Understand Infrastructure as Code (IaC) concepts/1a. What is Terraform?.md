## What is infrastructure as Code?
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools allow you to manage infrastructure with configuration files rather than through a graphical user interface.
IaC allows you to build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way by defining resource configurations that you can version, reuse and share.

## What is Terraform?
Hashicorp Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-premises resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share.

## How does Terraform work?
Terraform creates and manages resources on cloud platforms and other services through their application programming interfaces (APIs).
Providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, Helm, Github, Splunk and many more enables Terraform to work with virtually any platform or service with an accessible API.

The core workflow consists of three stages:
- **Write**: You define resources, which may be across multiple cloud providers and services.
- **Plan**: Terraform creates an execution plan describing the infrastructure it will create, update, or destroy based on the existing infrastructure and your configuration.
- **Apply**: On approval, Terraform performs the proposed operations in the correct order, respecting any resources dependencies.

## Why Terraform?
### Manage any infrastructure
Find providers for many of the platforms and services you already use in the Terraform Registry. You can also write your own. Terraform takes an immutable approach to infrastructure, reducing the complexity of upgrading or modifying your services and infrastructure.

### Track your infrastructure
Terraform generates a plan and prompts for approval before modifying the infrastructure. It also keeps track of your real infrastructure in a state file, which acts as a source of truth for environment.

### Automate changes 
Terraform configuration files are declarative, meaning that they describe the end state of your infrastructure. You do not need to write step-by-step instructions to create resources because Terraform handles the underlying logic. Terraform builds a resource graph to determine resource dependencies and creates or modifies nondependent resources in parallel.

### Standardize configurations
Terraform supports reusable configuration components called modules that define configurable collections of infrastructure, saving time and encouraging best practices. You can publicly available modules from the Terraform Registry, or write your own.

### Collaborate
Since your configuration is written in a file, you can commit it to a Version Control System.
